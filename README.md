# Basic-Network-Scanning
Steps Performed
First, I opened the Kali terminal and found my system's IP range.

Then, I used the nmap command: sudo nmap -sS <system ip> to scan for open ports.

I noted the open ports that were found.

After finding the open ports, I checked the security risks associated with each one.

Finally, I used Wireshark to analyze the packet capture.

Thank you.
